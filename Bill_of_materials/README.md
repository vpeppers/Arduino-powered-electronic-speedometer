These are the parts that I used to build the speedometer.  I have not included the breadboards, or the breadboard connecting wires.  I also have not included the wires to connect the various components.

The USB port and cable are used to reprogram the Arduino, should that be necessary.  Insert the USB cable into the Arduino, and afix it with hot glue.
